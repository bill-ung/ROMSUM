ROMSUM is a command-line utility that calculates a straight checksum value,
for any given image. ROMSUM was written primarily for the pinball world,
and the utility is designed to recognize known EPROM sizes.  It also includes
the ability to calculate the checksum for each 0x1000 page, which is helpful
when working with Williams System 11{A,B,C} ROMs.
