The Pinball Rom Identifier is an extension of the ROMSUM utility.  You may select any ROM file you may have and upload it here.  The tool will attempt to match the file against known ROM images, based on file size and checksum values.  If a match is found, the game information and details for the specific EPROM chip are displayed.
<br><br>
If your file does not match, send an <a HREF="http://www.ufopinball.com/contact.htm">E-Mail</a> and I'll see if I can identify your file manually.  Once identified, you may also wish to submit the file to the IPDB and/or PinMAME as a contribution to the pinball hobby.
<br><br>
This is an experimental tool, written by <a TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="http://www.ufopinball.com/contact.htm">Bill Ung</a> using Linux (CentOS), Apache (http), MySQL (MariaDB) and PHP, plus HTML/JavaScript
<br>
Database information was generated from personally collected ROM files, the
<a TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="http://www.ipdb.org">Internet Pinball Database (IPDB)</a>, and the
<a TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="http://pinmame.retrogames.com">PinMAME project</a>.
